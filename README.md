# DIGIT-IMAGE-RECOGNITION-PREDICTIVE-SYSTEM
Creating a predictive system for recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset is a common task in machine learning and computer vision. In this README, I will outline the steps and considerations for building a simple MNIST digit image predictive system using Python and popular machine learning libraries like TensorFlow and Keras.
